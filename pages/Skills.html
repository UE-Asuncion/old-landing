          <li>3d Modeling</li>
          <p><strong>W</strong>ith my hobby of playing video games I naturally became interested in video game development <sup>1</sup>. This was when I was in senior high, with my growing interest in the development process I naturally became interest in 3d models <sup>2</sup>. Fortunately, my senior high had us make a project creating 3d models which introduce me to the 3d software <q>Blender</q> <sup>3</sup>. With my limited skill concerning 3d modeling, I made something simple <sup>4</sup>. I modeled a simple bow and we had it 3d printed it because it was part of the project <sup>5</sup>. After this project however our class did not have any more projects in relation to 3d modeling <sup>6</sup>. So I took it upon myself to study and familiarize myself to 3d modeling <sup>7</sup>. My goal was to create something realistic <sup>8</sup>. Unfortunately, my laptop doesn't have the specs to render something I wanted <sup>9</sup>. So I had to tone the realism down but this doesn't mean it was a bad choice because this actually led me to find a way achieve some realism in my models even if the model is relatively low poly <sup>10</sup>.

          <li>Programming</li>
          <p><strong>W</strong>hen I was in high school I didn't really know what course to choose in senior high <sup>1</sup>. But since I was already quite interested in computers <sup>2</sup>. I decided to choose ICT in my senior high <sup>3</sup>. I was first introduced to the Java language <sup>4</sup>. In terms of difficulty, I would say it was like an intermediate level, it wasn't too hard and it wasn't too easy either <sup>5</sup>. I also like the process of creating the programs even if there are just terminal programs <sup>6</sup>. Later on, I learned many other programming languages like C-sharp, python, and C++ <sup>7</sup>. Because of my interest in Video Game Development, I decided to try out unity, a game engine <sup>8</sup>. I didn't get too far in creating a game however as my laptop really had a hard time compiling even small changes in a script <sup>9</sup>. Nonetheless, That was the first time that I was able to learn how to use frameworks and API's, while I didn't get too far with actually creating a game I did learn some programming concepts like object-oriented programming and how to use frameworks and API so, in the end, it was still learning experience. <sup>10</sup>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <p><strong>W</strong>hen I was a child I was already into video games <sup> 1</sup>. It was partly because my mother bought me game consoles when she came back from japan<sup> 2</sup>. The games were in Japanese but that didn't stop me from liking the games I had on my console <sup> 3</sup>. My favorite games when I was a child were Sly Cooper, GTA: San Andreas, and a 3d Pacman which I forgot the name <sup> 4</sup>. In high school, my parents gifted me and my siblings an Xbox <sup> 4</sup>. I was able to play some different genres of games than the previous one I had <sup> 5</sup>. This was also the time when I leaned much more into action games than platformers <sup> 6</sup>. In my 8th grade of high school, I discovered another genre of a game called RPG, which focuses more on character skills customization <sup> 7</sup>. I really like this genre because I was able to customize my character not just in looks and RPG can also be played in a variety of play styles which is really nice for replayability <sup> 8</sup>. I also like stealth games, stealth games are really fun when it comes to the options that the player can do to finish a mission <sup> 9</sup>. My favorite genre of games is definitely RPG then stealth games <sup> 10</sup>.</p>

        <li>Anime and Comics/Manga</li>
        <p><strong>I</strong>n my high school I had a friend who introduce me to anime <sup>1</sup>. He introduce to different kinds of genres of anime <sup>2</sup>. Watching a show that I didn't know the language was a weird experience at first <sup>3</sup>. It took a while to get used to the characters speaking Japanese and reading the subtitles quickly because characters in anime just speaks a lot<sup>4</sup>. Of course there was also the option of watching its english dub which I can easily understand, I prefer it when the show I am watching is on its original language because for some reason it always sound weird when it isn't dub in it's original language <sup>5</sup>. Naturally liking anime I stumbled upon Japanese comics <sup>6</sup>. Much like anime's I also enjoyed reading the comics <sup>7</sup>. I think the art styles in a Japanese comic is very interesting <sup>8</sup>. There are realistic styles and some goofy styles which is more comedy <sup>9</sup>. Overall I really like the style and animation of manga and anime <sup>10</sup>.</p>

      <h2>Interest</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Video Game Development</li>
        <p><strong>I</strong> really like playing video games and even had some ideas on game mechanics or setting of a game <sup>1</sup>. This interest led me to try out unity <sup>2</sup>. Unfortunately, my laptop did not have the best specs when it comes to rendering graphics <sup>3</sup>. While my goal to create a game was unsuccessful I did learn a lot about programming so in the end I am still glad I decided to try it out <sup>4</sup>. If I can't make a full game I decided to try out making more game-ready models <sup>5</sup>. Since I already had a prior experience in 3d modeling this increased my skill in 3d modeling <sup>6</sup>. Since then I have been continuing to do 3d models. <sup>7</sup>. Albeit very slow because I had to stop modeling a bit to focus on college <sup>8</sup>. But Nonetheless, whenever I have time I make or continue my 3d projects <sup>9</sup>. For now I guess I will just continue creating 3d models and I guess save up money for a better computer <sup>10</sup>. </p>
        <li>3d Animation</li>
        <p><strong>M</strong>uch like 3d modeling <sup>1</sup>. I became interested in 3d animation because of my interest in game development <sup>2</sup>. Animation wasn't really my strong suite <sup>3</sup>. Learning animation is very different in modeling <sup>4</sup>. Different in the sense of references <sup>5</sup>. Unlike modeling, animation captures the movement<sup>6</sup>. A movement can be simple but can be actually complex to make it look realistic <sup>7</sup>. In modeling the model only captures the still object<sup>8</sup>. The only thing making modeling complex is the details, the roughness, the color, the wear and tear, etc. or just go for a cartoonish style and it can still look good <sup>9</sup>. Comparing both of them I think modeling is much easier <sup>10</sup>.</p>
