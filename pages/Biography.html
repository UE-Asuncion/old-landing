        <p><blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="font-size: 2em">W</strong>hen I was a child I was into video games. My mom bought me a PS2, and a PSP when she came back from Japan<sup>1</sup>. My favorite games at the time was Sly Cooper and a 3d Pacman game<sup>2</sup>. Although they were hard to understand because I was a child and the game was also in Japanese so I had my mom translate the menu text from time to time<sup>3</sup>. I was very hooked at these games and barely play outside in summer<sup>4</sup>. When school started my play time became less and less my parents also became strict when it comes to studying so I usually don't have enough time to play<sup>5</sup>. While my play time with the consoles were less, I found the time to play outside and meet some new kids around my age<sup>6</sup>. Fortunately enough I also have other interest to keep me entertained in which also led me befriend another kid<sup>7</sup>. I was able to befriend another kid in my school and one near our house<sup>8</sup>. We were interested at toy cars and transformers<sup>9</sup>. Fast forward to 5ft grade<sup>10</sup>. I asked a friend of mine to teach me how to play chess<sup>11</sup>. This started me to play competitively for my school on a local tournament<sup>12</sup>. My most memorable moment, was when I beat multiple highschool student of our school<sup>13</sup>. The tournament went well and I was able to get to 3rd place<sup>14</sup>. I also remember that I almost won my last match that could place me to 2nd place<sup>15</sup>. On 6th grade I joined again on the local tournament<sup>16</sup>. Unfortunately, I didn't get to to top 3<sup>17</sup>. It was at that grade were I just wanted to play casually<sup>18</sup>. I still joined the tournament because there are some perks like we can skip classes granted that we're training on the specific sport<sup>19</sup>. Even then I was still interested in chess but in a casual way instead of tournaments<sup>20</sup>.

      <p><blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong style="font-size: 2em">A</strong>t this time my interest in video games sparked again<sup>1</sup>. My parents bought me and my siblings an Xbox console<sup>2</sup>. I was able to play some different game genre unlike the one's I play in my PS2 and PSP<sup>3</sup>. I also still play chess at this time<sup>4</sup>. My school at the time has a yearly school sports tournament<sup>5</sup>. I decided to join the chess segment of the event since I don't get to play that much anymore unless I join some tournament<sup>6</sup>. However, unlike the local tournament it's not really required to train since it just a school event so it was easier for me<sup>7</sup>. I also encountered another board game at the school event which intrigue me<sup>8</sup>. It was the Game of the Generals<sup>9</sup>. This was an interesting game for me, 2 players is not able to see their opponents pieces rank and at the start the players can place their pieces anywhere they want<sup>10</sup>. The game however needs 3 people to play, 2 players and 1 for an arbiter who can see the 2 players pieces rank<sup>11</sup>. At my 2nd year of high school I got my first smartphone<sup>12</sup>. I actually had to convince my parent to give me their phone if they are going to change their's so instead of selling they gave it to me<sup>13</sup>. Because I was very interest in video games it led me too emulation of PSP games<sup>14</sup>. That discovery was like goldmine for me because I was able to play games that I haven't even when I had a PSP<sup>15</sup>. A friend of mine also introduce me to watch anime<sup>16</sup>. Fast forward to my senior high days, I had to change school because there is no IT course on my old school<sup>17</sup>. I picked IT because I was interested in computers<sup>18</sup>. This course was also my first introduction to programming<sup>19</sup>. Surprisingly I was able to keep and I did decent in terms of grades<sup>20</sup>.

      <p><blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong style="font-size: 2em">A</strong>fter graduating senior high I had no idea what college to pick<sup>1</sup>. For starters I handed necessary information to UP, which I doubt I would get in but I still did it<sup>2</sup>. Then I tried applying to Bulacan college<sup>3</sup>. Unfortunately I forgot the date of the entrance exam and so my admission got voided<sup>4</sup>. I tried FEU but their admission due date already passed and then father suggested I try UE<sup>4</sup>. Fortunately the due date for admission hasn't passed and there was no exam<sup>5</sup>. At this point I already know the course I wanted to go and that was Computer Science<sup>6</sup>. I followed the admission process paid my tuition fee<sup>7</sup>. The funny thing about this is that I haven't gone to UE even once till my 2nd year 2nd sem<sup>8</sup>. Online classes were pretty boring<sup>9</sup>. Honestly most of the classes I was spacing out and scrolling through social media<sup>10</sup>. I did pretty well surprisingly and didn't fail any subjects<sup>11</sup>. Granted that I have to self study a bit more because most of the time I wasn't listening<sup>12</sup>. Online exam has some strict rules too but is understandable<sup>13</sup>. What I don't like however on online exams is that most of the teachers always lock previous answers<sup>14</sup>. Paper exams was much easier in that regard and saves so much time, because if I don't know the answer on a question I'll just move on for now and come back to it later in case I remember the answer but with locking questions on online exams I had to spend so much time on just one question before I can move on<sup>15</sup>. That kind feature honestly stresses me out because time is ticking and I can't answer other questions without doing the current question even if I remember the answer after pressing next I can't do anything about it<sup>16</sup>. Now that it is face-to-face classes I am hoping that most teachers will not lock previous answer<sup>17</sup>. During online classes I discovered a 3d application called Blender<sup>18</sup>. Because of youtube algorithm for video suggestion I came across this app<sup>19</sup>. I enjoyed creating 3d models and decided to make it my hobby and maybe be good enough to even sell my creations<sup>20</sup>.
